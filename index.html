    <h3>CS 212 Fall 2024</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>● C language and Linux commands</li>
      <li>● Algorithmic problem solving, levels of abstraction, object-oriented design and programming, software organization, analysis of algorithm and data structures.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Project 2D</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>● Command-Line Math Operations</li>
      <li>● Developed a C program that takes three command-line arguments: two numbers and a math operation.</li>
      <li>● Implemented validation for both valid and invalid inputs, ensuring proper detection of errors (e.g., invalid operators, incorrect arguments).</li>
      <li>● The program performs the specified math operation and outputs the result, ensuring no use of C library functions like atoi, atof, or strcmp.</li>
      <li>● Focused on parsing and converting string inputs to perform operations, while adhering to constraints such as using double for precision.</li>
    </ul>
